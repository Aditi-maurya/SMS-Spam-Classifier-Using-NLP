# SMS-Spam-Classifier-Using-NLP
An SMS spam classifier is a machine learning-based system that automatically categorizes incoming SMS messages as either spam or ham (not spam).In the era of digital communication, SMS (Short Message Service) has become a widely used mode of communication. However, with its popularity, the issue of spam messages has increased significantly. These spam messages include promotional offers, phishing attempts, and fraudulent schemes. To combat this, an SMS Spam Classifier using Natural Language Processing (NLP) is developed to automatically detect and filter spam messages from genuine ones (ham messages).The goal of an SMS spam classifier is to identify and filter out spam messages, ensuring a better user experience.
